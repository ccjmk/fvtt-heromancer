# fvtt-heromancer
Heromancer - DnD 5e character creation/level up assistant for Foundry VTT

## Roadmap
This are the features I expect to add as I build up the module and macros, and I learn more about the API. These should be followed in order probably.

* Been able to create a 1st level character with all-rolled stats and SRD races and classes (only SRD race and class features, nothing else)
* Adding vision to token based on race
* Allow for moving stats around on creation, and use either 4d6kh3 rolls or standard array
* Add class starting items
* Allow point-buy
* Been able to choose subclass for 1st level subclasses, and add those features too
* Picking 1st level spells from class spell list
* UI for process, with button on Actors directory <-------- 1.0 release candidate
* Adding a button on the character sheet for leveling up (updating only non-ASI class features - new features, more uses to resources, total HP, etc)
* ASIs
* updating race features on level up <-------------- 2.0 release candidate
* feats ?
* don't fly to close to the sun, you can continue brainstorming later! :)

## Cool Stuff for later

* Tokenizer integration, so you can set avatar and token while creating character
* Custom races (probably a setting where you can specify compendiums other than 5e SRD to load custom races/race feature items, following SRD templates)
* Custom subclasses (probably a setting like Custom Races)
* Backgrounds
* Custom classes (probably a setting like Custom Races)
* Custom feats (probably a setting like Custom Races)
